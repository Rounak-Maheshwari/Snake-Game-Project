# Snake Game Project

This is a simple Snake Game built using Python and the Pygame library. The game allows the player to control a snake that grows longer as it eats food. The goal is to avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script to start the game.
2. Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
3. The snake will grow each time it eats food.
4. Avoid running into walls or the snakeâ€™s own body, or the game will be over.
5. Your current score will be displayed at the top of the screen, along with the highest score achieved during the session.
